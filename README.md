# Finance Help
Just a simple Finance help that calculates basic financial information such as knowing how much your expenses, income, profit, groceries, resources and how much you should save.

**FLASK Update:** I added a few Flask Python files just for me to get more familiar with FLASK and understand what it's used for. 

## Why?
This was an assignment from one of my classes and I thought of sharing that project to GitHub. I also wanted to dive into I/O and how to open, read, append and write on files.

**FLASK Update:** This is probably one of my biggest learning opportunities in Python since learning the language as I have learned more about Flask itself and its libraries such as SQLAlchemy, CORS, config, migrate and more.

Note: If you are wondering what I got for this assignment, it's 100%. I love Python.
